  'The Kuiper belt is a ring-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun and extending from the orbit of Neptune at 30 AU to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt (but about 20 times larger) and consists mainly of small, irregularly shaped bodies.',
  'The Kuiper belt is home to most of the objects that astronomers generally accept as dwarf planets: Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, Quaoar, and Orcus. Pluto was considered a planet prior to 2006, but its status was changed following the discovery of other similar bodies.',
  'Most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of a mixture of rock and frozen methane, ammonia, and water. The temperature of the belt is only about 50\xa0K (-223\xa0째C), so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid.',
  'The first spacecraft to explore the Kuiper belt was New Horizons, which flew by Pluto in 2015 and by Arrokoth in 2019. The exploration continues, and new missions are planned.'

export const Pluto: string[] = [
  'Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is the ninth largest and tenth most massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is also the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume. Pluto\'s eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable 2:3 orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.',
  'Pluto is the first known object in the Kuiper belt, discovered in 1930. It was classified as the 9th planet until its status was changed in 2006 following the discovery of other similar objects in the Kuiper belt. In 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft made a close approach to Pluto, sending back a large amount of images and other scientific data.',
  'Pluto has five known moons: Charon (with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are tidally locked.',
  'Pluto\'s surface is quite varied, with large differences in both brightness and color. The plains on Pluto\'s surface are composed of more than 98% nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. The mountains are made of water ice.'

export const Haumea: string[] = [
  'Haumea is a dwarf planet, discovered in 2004. It is estimated to be the third largest known trans-Neptunian object. It has two small natural satellites, Hiiaka and Namaka.',
  'Although Haumea\'s shape has not been directly observed, calculations suggest that it is close to an ellipsoid, with its major axis twice as long as its minor axis. Haumea rapidly rotates with a period of just under 4 hours, which causes it to be elongated.',
  'Haumea is as bright as snow. Modeling of the surface spectra suggested that 66% to 80% of the Haumean surface appears to be pure crystalline water ice. Inorganic cyanide salts, such as copper potassium cyanide, may also be present.',
  'In 2017, astronomers announced the discovery of a ring system around Haumea, representing the first ring system discovered for a trans-Neptunian object and a dwarf planet.'

export const Makemake: string[] = [
  'Makemake is a dwarf planet, discovered in 2005. It has one known natural satellite, about 175\xa0km in diameter.',
  'The rotation period of Makemake is estimated at 22.83 hours, which is relatively long for a dwarf planet. This may be explained by tidal acceleration from its satellite.',
  'Makemake lacks a substantial atmosphere and has extremely low average temperature, about 40\xa0K (-230\xa0째C). Its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices. Makemake shows signs of geothermal activity and thus may be capable of supporting active geology and harboring an active subsurface ocean.'

  'Quaoar is a dwarf planet, discovered in 2002. It has a shape of an elongated ellipsoid with the size of about 1286\u00d71080\u00d7932\xa0km.',
  'Quaoar has one known moon, Weywot, which is about 200\xa0km in diameter and was discovered in 2007. In 2023, astronomers announced the discovery of two thin rings orbiting Quaoar.',
  'Quaoar has a dark, moderately red surface that reflects about 12% of the visible light it receives from the Sun. Its mean temperature is about 44\xa0K (-229\xa0째C). Spectroscopic observations revealed signs of crystalline water ice and ammonia hydrate on the surface, with small quantities of solid methane and ethane.'

export const Orcus: string[] = [
  'Orcus is a dwarf planet, discovered in 2004. It has one large moon, Vanth, with a diameter of 443\xa0km, about half the size of Orcus.',
  'Much like Pluto, Orcus is locked in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune, making two revolutions around the Sun to every three of Neptune\'s. Orcus is at aphelion near the time when Pluto is at perihelion and vice versa. The perihelion of Orcus\'s orbit is around 120째 from that of Pluto, while the eccentricities and inclinations are similar.',
  'The surface of Orcus is relatively bright, reflecting about 23% of light, and neutral in color. It is rich in water ice, predominantly in crystalline form, which may be related to past cryovolcanic activity. Other compounds, like methane or ammonia, may also be present on it.'
