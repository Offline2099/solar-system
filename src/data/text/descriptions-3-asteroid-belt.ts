  'The asteroid belt is a ring-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun and spanning roughly the space between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It consists of a large number of solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids.',
  'The asteroid belt is estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million objects larger than 1 kilometer in diameter, and millions of smaller ones. Despite their apparent abundance, asteroids are thinly distributed. On average, they are about one million kilometers apart.',
  'About 60% of the belt\'s mass is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. Ceres is about 950 km in diameter, large enough to be considered a dwarf planet.',
  'There are 3 main types of asteroids by composition. Carbon-rich (C-type) asteroids dominate the belt\'s outer regions and comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids. Silicate-rich (S-type) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt. Metal-rich (M-type) asteroids are typically found in the middle.'

export const Ceres: string[] = [
  'Ceres is a dwarf planet in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the only one within the orbit of Neptune. It was previously classified as an asteroid. Ceres makes up 40% of the estimated mass of the asteroid belt.',
  'Ceres is too small to be seen with the naked eye. It was discovered with a telescope in 1801, becoming the first known object in the asteroid belt. Little was known about Ceres until NASA\'s robotic spacecraft Dawn approached it in 2015.',
  'Ceres lacks plate tectonics. The vast majority of its surface features formed either due to impacts or cryovolcanic activity. Ceres has one prominent mountain, Ahuna Mons, which appears to be a cryovolcano.'

export const Vesta: string[] = [
  'Vesta is the second largest object in the asteroid belt, both by mass and by volume. It constitutes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt.',
  'Vesta is the brightest asteroid visible from Earth. It was discovered in 1807. NASA\'s robotic spacecraft Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012, fully mapping its surface.',
  'Vesta is the only known remaining rocky protoplanet of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets. Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron-nickel core 214-226 km in diameter, an overlying rocky mantle, and a surface crust.',
  'The most prominent surface features of Vesta are two enormous craters: the Rheasilvia crater, centered near the south pole, and the Veneneia crater in the southern hemisphere.'

export const Pallas: string[] = [
  'Pallas is the third largest asteroid in the Solar System by volume and mass. It was discovered in 1802. Pallas constitutes an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt.',
  'The orbit of Pallas has an unusually high inclination of 34.8° to the plane of the asteroid belt, making it more difficult to reach with a spacecraft. Pallas also has a very high axial tilt of 84°.',
  'Pallas is estimated to have a composition similar to other carbon-rich asteroids in the outer regions of the asteroid belt. It may also contain a significant amount of silicate minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, and some proportion of metals like nickel and iron.'

export const Hygiea: string[] = [
  'Hygiea is the fourth largest asteroid in the Solar System, it constitutes an estimated 3% of the mass of the asteroid belt.',
  'Despite its size, Hygiea appears very dim when observed from Earth due to its position in the outer main belt and relatively dark surface. Hygiea was discovered in 1849, when a number of smaller asteroids was already known.',
  'Hygiea has a nearly spherical shape. It consists primarily of rocky materials, metals, and water ice. The average surface temperature on Hygiea is about 164\xa0K (-109\xa0°C).'
