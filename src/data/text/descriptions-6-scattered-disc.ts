export const ScatteredDisc: string[] = [
  'The scattered disc a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun. It is sparsely populated by small icy bodies of irregular shape, which are among the coldest and most distant objects in the Solar System. They are composed largely of frozen water and methane.',
  'The scattered disc objects have highly eccentric orbits that approach the Sun at about 30-35 AU and can extend well beyond 100 AU, sometimes with inclinations as high as 40°. In contrast to the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc objects can be disturbed by Neptune\'s gravity at their closest approaches to the Sun.',
  'Because of its unstable nature, astronomers now consider the scattered disc to be the place of origin for most short-period comets, as those may have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of Neptune and other outer planets.'

export const Eris: string[] = [
  'Eris is the most massive and second largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. It was discovered in 2005 and remains the largest known object in the Solar System that has not been visited by a spacecraft. Eris has one large known moon, Dysnomia, with an estimated diameter of 615\xa0km.',
  'The surface of Eris appears almost white and uniform. Its temperature is estimated to vary from about 30\xa0K to 56\xa0K (-243\xa0°C to -217\xa0°C). Infrared spectroscopy revealed the presence of methane ice and substantial quantities of nitrogen ice, indicating that the surface may be similar to that of Pluto, but condensation of methane spread uniformly over the surface possibly reduces any contrasts.'

export const Gonggong: string[] = [
  'Gonggong is a dwarf planet, discovered in 2007. It has a highly eccentric and inclined orbit in a 3:10 orbital resonance with Neptune, which means it completes three orbits around the Sun for every ten orbits completed by Neptune. Gonggong has one natural satellite, Xiangliu, about 100\xa0km in diameter.',
  'The surface of Gonggong reflects about 14% of light. Gonggong is among the reddest known trans-Neptunian objects. Spectroscopic observations revealed significant amounts of ethane ice and the presence of methane and carbon dioxide. It is also likely to contain trace amounts of other volatiles, including ammonia, carbon monoxide, and possibly nitrogen.'
