  'Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. Its mass is greater than the mass of all the other planets combined.',
  'Jupiter is a gas giant. It is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of other elements. Unlike terrestrial planets, it does not have a well-defined solid surface.',
  'Jupiter\'s atmosphere is characterized by alternating bands of light and dark clouds running parallel to its equator, caused by strong winds reaching the speeds of 600 kilometers per hour. The most prominent feature in Jupiter\'s atmosphere is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm system larger than Earth that has been observed for centuries.',
  'Jupiter has dozens of natural satellites. The four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons after their discoverer Galileo Galilei, are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are some of the most geologically active bodies in the solar system, with features such as volcanoes, ice-covered oceans, and rocky surfaces.',
  'Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s and 1980s, the Galileo orbiter in the 1990s, and the Juno spacecraft, which arrived in orbit around Jupiter in 2016.'

  'Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System.',
  'Saturn is a gas giant. It does not have a well-defined solid surface. It is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 96%) and helium (about 3%) with trace amounts of other elements. Saturn has a lower density than water.',
  'Saturn has banded cloud patterns running parallel to its equator, caused by strong winds in its upper atmosphere. It also features a hexagonally shaped jet stream near the planet\'s north pole.',
  'Saturn is famous for its large ring system, which consists of icy particles and bodies ranging in size from micrometers to several meters. The rings extend tens of thousands of kilometers from the planet\'s equator, but are only about 10 meters thick.',
  'Saturn has over a hundred natural satellites. Notable moons of Saturn include Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, and Enceladus, which has geysers of water vapor erupting from its surface.',
  'Saturn has been visited by several probes, including the Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s and 1980s, which provided the first close-up images of the planet. The Cassini-Huygens mission orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, providing detailed observations of the planet, its rings, and its moons.'

export const Uranus: string[] = [
  'Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-colored ice giant.',
  'The planet consists mostly of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter.  Uranus has the lowest minimum temperature (-224\xa0°C) out of all the Solar System\'s planets.',
  'Uranus\' atmosphere is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium. It has a complex layered cloud structure and relatively few visible cloud features or turbulence.',
  'Uranus is tilted at an angle of about 82 degrees relative to its orbit. This means that the planet essentially rotates on its side as it orbits the Sun. Each pole experiences about 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.',
  'Uranus has over 20 known moons. It also has a system of narrow, dark rings composed of dust particles and small chunks of ice. Unlike the more prominent rings of Saturn, Uranus\' rings are relatively faint and were not discovered until 1977.',
  'Uranus has only been visited by one spacecraft, Voyager\xa02 in 1986, which provided the first and only close-up images of the planet and its moons. No other spacecraft has flown by Uranus since then.'

  'Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun.',
  'Neptune is an ice giant. It no well-defined solid surface. Neptune\'s composition includes hydrogen, helium, water, ammonia, and methane.',
  'Neptune\'s atmosphere is known for its dynamic and turbulent weather patterns, including winds that can reach speeds of 2,000 kilometers per hour. Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune\'s outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching -218\xa0°C.',
  'Neptune has over a dozen of known moons, with the largest and most notable being Triton. The planet also has a faint system of rings composed primarily of dust particles and small rocks.',
  'Neptune is not visible to the naked eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that was found based on mathematical predictions. Neptune has only been visited by one spacecraft, Voyager\xa02, which flew by the planet in 1989 and provided the first and only close-up images of the planet and its moons.'
