  'Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. It is one of the four terrestrial planets. Mercury has no natural satellites.',
  'The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of multiple impact events that have accumulated over billions of years in the absence of an atmosphere. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km and is one-third the diameter of the planet.',
  'Mercury has widely varying surface temperatures, with the equatorial regions ranging from -170\xa0°C at night to 420\xa0°C during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet\'s poles are permanently shadowed.',
  'Mercury is visible to the naked eye and has been observed since the ancient times. The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA\'s Mariner\xa010 in 1974-1975, which mapped about 45% of the planet\'s surface. The second NASA probe, named MESSENGER, orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015, collecting a variety of scientific data.'

  'Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has no natural satellites.',
  'Venus has the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. It has an average surface temperature of 464\xa0°C and an atmospheric pressure 92 times greater than on Earth at sea level.',
  'Venus lacks plate tectonics, which has led to fewer geological features like mountains and valleys compared to Earth. Radar mapping has revealed vast volcanic plains, highland regions, and thousands of volcanoes, some of which may still be active.',
  'Venus is visible to the naked eye, and it is the third brightest object in the Earth\'s sky. It always appears close to the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star".',
  'The first spacecraft to fly past Venus was Venera\xa01 in 1961. In 1966, Venera\xa03 became the first probe to reach the planet\'s surface. The first images from the surface were obtained by Venera\xa09 in 1975. Between 1990 and 1994, Magellan spacecraft operated in orbit and mapped the planet. There have been a few dozen of successful flyby missons.'

export const Earth: string[] = [
  'Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only known planet to support life. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon.',
  'Earth has a stronger magnetic field than other terresrial planets. It prevents the Earth\'s atmosphere from getting blown away by the solar wind and protects the planet\'s surface from harmful cosmic radiation.',
  'Earth\'s atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet.',
  'Earth is the only planet in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Most of the planet\'s surface is covered by oceans (70.8%), with the remaining 29.2% is occupied by continents and islands. Earth\'s surface has various geological features shaped by erosion, tectonic activity, and volcanic eruptions.',
  'Earth has a wide variety of climate zones and ecosystems (forests, grasslands, deserts, tundra, marine and freshwater biomes, polar ice caps), each with its own biodiversity.'

export const Mars: string[] = [
  'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the outermost terrestrial planet. It is the second smallest planet of the Solar System. Mars has two natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.',
  'Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with a surface pressure of 6 to 7 millibars, less than 1% of Earth\'s. The atmosphere is quite dusty due to iron oxide particles suspended in it. Surface temperatures vary from about -110\xa0°C to 35\xa0°C and follow seasonal patterns.',
  'The surface of Mars is orange-red, covered in iron oxide dust. The relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered terrain in southern highlands. Mars hosts many enormous extinct volcanos (such as Olympus Mons, 21.9 km tall) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km long). The planet\'s polar ice caps are composed of water and carbon dioxide.',
  'Mars is visible to the naked eye and has been observed since the ancient times. The first flyby was achieved by in 1965 by the Mariner\xa04 probe. The first spacecraft to orbit the planet was the Mars\xa02 probe in 1971. The first landing was made by the Viking\xa01 probe in 1976. Since the early 21st century, Mars has been actively explored by unmanned spacecraft and rovers.'

  'The Moon is the Earth\'s only natural satellite.',
  'The Moon\'s mass is 1.2% of Earth\'s, and its diameter is roughly one-quarter of Earth\'s. Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet. It is also larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets.',
  'The Moon is tidally locked, which means that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. The Moon\'s surface is covered in lunar dust and is marked by mountains, impact craters, and dark plains of cooled magma.',
  'The first man-made object to reach the Moon was the Luna\xa02 probe in 1959. In 1969, humans landed on the Moon for the first time, which was also the first human landing on an extraterrestrial body. Five more crews visited the Moon between 1969 and 1972.'

  'Phobos is the innermost and larger of the two natural satellites of Mars. It is a small, irregularly shaped object.',
  'Phobos orbits closer to Mars than any other known natural satellite of a planet. It orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates. As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day.',
  'Phobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System. A notable feature of Phobos is the large impact crater, Stickney, which takes up a substantial portion of its surface. Temperatures on Phobos range from about -4\xa0°C on the sunlit side to -112\xa0°C on the shadowed side.'

  'Deimos is the smaller and outer of the two natural satellites of Mars. It is highly non-spherical with the dimensions of 16.1\u00d711.8\u00d710.2\xa0km.',
  'Deimos may be an asteroid that was perturbed by Jupiter into an orbit that allowed it to be captured by Mars, although this hypothesis is disputed. Deimos is composed of rock rich in carbonaceous material, similar to C-type asteroids and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.',
  'The surface of Deimos is cratered, but appears much smoother than that of Phobos. The escape velocity from Deimos is only about 5.6 m/s, a speed that could theoretically be reached by a human performing a vertical jump.'
