export const radius: Definition = {
  term: 'Radius',
  explanation: [
    ' of a spherical body is the distance from its center to its surface.',
    'Stars and planets have slightly irregular shapes due to their rotation, so the value represents the average radius.'
  ]
}

export const meanDiameter: Definition = {
  term: 'Mean diameter',
  explanation: [
    ' of an astronomical object is the average value that represents its size.',
    'For dwarf planets with a nearly spherical shape, it is close to the diameter of the sphere.',
    'Asteroids can have irregular shapes, so their diameters can vary significantly depending on which axis the measurement is taken.'
  ]
}

export const mass: Definition = {
  term: 'Mass',
  explanation: [' determines the strength of the gravitational force exerted by the body on other objects. It is also a measure of the body\'s inertia, or resistance to acceleration when a force is applied.']
}

export const density: Definition = {
  term: 'Density',
  explanation: [
    ' of a substance is its mass per unit of volume. Heavier materials have higher densities.',
    ' For celestial bodies, the value represents the average density, derived as the ratio of the total mass to the body\'s volume.'
  ]
}

export const surfaceGravity: Definition = {
  term: 'Surface gravity',
  explanation: [' is the gravitational acceleration experienced at the surface of a celestial body at the equator. For planets with no well-defined surfaces, it is given at the 1\xa0bar pressure level in the atmosphere.']
}

export const escapeVelocity: Definition = {
  term: 'Escape velocity',
  explanation: [' is the minimum speed required for an object to escape from the gravitational pull of the celestial body.']
}

export const semiMajorAxis: Definition = {
  term: 'Semi-major axis',
  explanation: [' of an elliptical orbit is the mean value of the maximum and minimum distances from the Sun.']
}

export const perihelion: Definition = {
  term: 'Perihelion',
  explanation: [' is the nearest point of a body\'s orbit around the Sun.']
}

export const aphelion: Definition = {
  term: 'Aphelion',
  explanation: [' is the farthest point of a body\'s orbit around the Sun.']
}

export const orbitalPeriod: Definition = {
  term: 'Orbital period',
  explanation: [' is the amount of time it takes for an astronomical object to complete one orbit.']
}

export const orbitalSpeed: Definition = {
  term: 'Orbital speed',
  explanation: [' is the speed at which an astronomical object travels along its orbit.']
}

export const siderealPeriod: Definition = {
  term: 'Sidereal period',
  explanation: [' is the amount of time it takes for an astronomical object to rotate full 360° on its axis.']
}

export const synodicPeriod: Definition = {
  term: 'Synodic period',
  explanation: [' is the amount of time it takes for an astronomical object to rotate once on its axis in relation to the body it orbits. This rotation is slightly different from 360°, since the direction to the body changes as the object moves along the orbit.']
}

export const axialTilt: Definition = {
  term: 'Axial tilt',
  explanation: [' is the angle between the object\'s rotational axis and the line perpendicular to its orbital plane.']
}

export const axialRotationPeriod: Definition = {
  term: 'Axial rotation period',
  explanation: [
    ' is the amount of time it takes for the star to rotate full 360° on its axis.',
    'Stars are composed of gaseous plasma, which allows for different rotation speeds at different latitudes. The rate of rotation is observed to be the fastest at the equator and slower near the poles.'

export const galacticOrbitRadius: Definition = {
  term: 'Galactic radius ',
  explanation: [' is the average distance from the star to the center of the galaxy.']
}

export const galacticOrbitPeriod: Definition = {
  term: 'Galactic orbital period',
  explanation: [' is the amount of time it takes for a star to complete one orbit around the center of the galaxy.']
}

export const galacticOrbitSpeed: Definition = {
  term: 'Galactic orbital speed',
  explanation: [' is the speed at which a star travels along its orbit around the center of the galaxy.']
}

export const astronomicalUnit: Definition = {
  term: 'Astronomical unit (AU)',
  explanation: [' is a unit of length equal to the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.']

export const lightYear: Definition = {
  term: 'Light-year',
  explanation: [' is the distance that light travels in a vacuum in one year (365.25\xa0days).']
