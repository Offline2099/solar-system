  'The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Every second, the Sun\'s core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 million tons of matter into energy.',
  'The Sun formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Its is now about halfway through its main-sequence stage, and will run out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years.',
  'The Sun goes through an 11-year solar cycle, during which the number of sunspots (regions of reduced temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic flux that appear darker on the Sun\'s surface) and solar flares (localized outbursts of electromagnetic radiation) varies.'

  'Mercury has widely varying surface temperatures, with the equatorial regions ranging from -170\xa0°C at night to 420\xa0°C during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet\'s poles are permanently shadowed.',
  'Mercury is visible to the naked eye and has been observed since the ancient times. The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA\'s Mariner\xa010 in 1974-1975, which mapped about 45% of the planet\'s surface. The second NASA probe, named MESSENGER, orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015, collecting a variety of scientific data.'
