  'The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System, around which all the planets orbit. It is classified as a G-type main-sequence star (G2V).',
  'The visible surface of the Sun is known as the photosphere, where the temperature is around 5,500\xa0°C. The Sun\'s core reaches a much higher temperature of about 15.7\xa0million\xa0°C.',
  'The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Every second, the Sun\'s core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 million tons of matter into energy.',
  'The Sun formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Its is now about halfway through its main-sequence stage, and will run out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years.',
  'The Sun goes through an 11-year solar cycle, during which the number of sunspots (regions of reduced temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic flux that appear darker on the Sun\'s surface) and solar flares (localized outbursts of electromagnetic radiation) varies.'

  'Mercury has widely varying surface temperatures, with the equatorial regions ranging from -170\xa0°C at night to 420\xa0°C during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet\'s poles are permanently shadowed.',
  'Mercury is visible to the naked eye and has been observed since the ancient times. The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA\'s Mariner\xa010 in 1974-1975, which mapped about 45% of the planet\'s surface. The second NASA probe, named MESSENGER, orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015, collecting a variety of scientific data.'

  'Venus lacks plate tectonics, which has led to fewer geological features like mountains and valleys compared to Earth. Radar mapping has revealed vast volcanic plains, highland regions, and thousands of volcanoes, some of which may still be active.',
  'Venus is visible to the naked eye, and it is the third brightest object in the Earth\'s sky. It always appears close to the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star".',
  'The first spacecraft to fly past Venus was Venera\xa01 in 1961. In 1966, Venera\xa03 became the first probe to reach the planet\'s surface. The first images from the surface were obtained by Venera\xa09 in 1975. Between 1990 and 1994, Magellan spacecraft operated in orbit and mapped the planet. There have been a few dozen of successful flyby missons.'

  'Earth\'s atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet.',
  'Earth is the only planet in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Most of the planet\'s surface is covered by oceans (70.8%), with the remaining 29.2% is occupied by continents and islands. Earth\'s surface has various geological features shaped by erosion, tectonic activity, and volcanic eruptions.',

  'Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with a surface pressure of 6 to 7 millibars, less than 1% of Earth\'s. The atmosphere is quite dusty due to iron oxide particles suspended in it. Surface temperatures vary from about -110\xa0°C to 35\xa0°C and follow seasonal patterns.',
  'The surface of Mars is orange-red, covered in iron oxide dust. The relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered terrain in southern highlands. Mars hosts many enormous extinct volcanos (such as Olympus Mons, 21.9 km tall) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km long). The planet\'s polar ice caps are composed of water and carbon dioxide.',
  'Mars is visible to the naked eye and has been observed since the ancient times. The first flyby was achieved by in 1965 by the Mariner\xa04 probe. The first spacecraft to orbit the planet was the Mars\xa02 probe in 1971. The first landing was made by the Viking\xa01 probe in 1976. Since the early 21st century, Mars has been actively explored by unmanned spacecraft and rovers.'

  'Jupiter\'s atmosphere is characterized by alternating bands of light and dark clouds running parallel to its equator, caused by strong winds reaching the speeds of 600 kilometers per hour. The most prominent feature in Jupiter\'s atmosphere is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm system larger than Earth that has been observed for centuries.',
  'Jupiter has dozens of natural satellites. The four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons after their discoverer Galileo Galilei, are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are some of the most geologically active bodies in the solar system, with features such as volcanoes, ice-covered oceans, and rocky surfaces.',
