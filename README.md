# Solar System

## Project Description

An overview of the Solar System with basic information about the Sun, planets, and other objects. Made in a futuristic sci-fi style.

*Each region of the Solar System, as well as each celestial body, is shown as a neat collapsible block filled with relevant data.

*Each data property has a hint that appears on hover and explains what it means in a brief and concise way. Values also have hints that show them converted to other measurement units, if applicable.

*The design is intended to look futuristic, inspired by various fictional UI often seen in sci-fi movies. At the same time, it is rather minimalistic and not overloaded with useless visual clutter.

*All elements are responsive and work smoothly on tablets or mobile screens.

*This project can be potentially expanded to include more detailed information about each planet, as well as moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other parts of the Solar System.
